          I am currently completing a degree in Live Production and Technical Arts at the Academy
  of Contemporary Music, where I have combined rigorous academic study with extensive
  practical experience in live events, broadcast, and studio production. My background also
  includes studies in Business, Music Production, and 3D Design, providing a strong foundation in
  both operational and creative disciplines.

          I specialise in audio, visual, and full-scale production management. My experience includes
rigging staging, patching and mixing live sound, configuring ATEM and OBS systems for
livestreaming, and coordinating technical teams to ensure events run efficiently. I am proficient
with a wide range of software platforms, including iWork, Google Workspace, and Office 365,
and I am confident in my ability to adapt to any digital environment or equipment provided.

          Notable highlights in my career to date include directing the Studio Lounge livestream series
(viewable on youtube here), managing production for True Feel, an independent festival held in
Guildfordâ€™s Electric Theatre, and serving as a sound assistant and runner for the Isle of Wight
Festival 2024 broadcast. Each of these roles has strengthened my ability to work under
pressure, communicate effectively, and maintain a high standard of professionalism.
